This version of the LAMMPS software package features an implementation of the
constant potential method (CPM).

The fix charge_update implements the CPM. Charges of groups specified as
group-ID and with the couple keyword are adapted to meet their respective
potential at every time step. An arbitrary number of electrodes can be set but
the respective groups may not overlap. Electrode charges have a Gaussian charge
distribution with reciprocal width eta. The energy minimization is achieved via
matrix inversion.

The fix necessitates the use of a long range solver that can provide the matrix
of electrode-electrode interactions and a vector of electrode-electrolyte
interactions. The Kspace styles ewald/conp and pppm/conp are created
specifically for this task.

For systems with non-periodic boundaries in one or two directions dipole
corrections are available with the kspace_modify. For ewald/conp a
two-dimensional Ewald summation can be used by setting “slab ew2d”:

Examples can be found in the directory "./examples/USER/conp/".

In order to install the package with cmake use "cmake -D PKG_USER-CONP=yes ."
and make sure the KSPACE package is installed.
