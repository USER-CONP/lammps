Description
"""""""""""

    The fix charge_update implements the constant potential method (CPM)
    (:ref:`Siepmann <Siepmann>`, :ref:`Reed <Reed3>`).
    Charges of groups specified as group-ID and with the `couple` keyword are
    adapted to meet their respective potential at every time step.
    An arbitrary number of electrodes can be set but the respective groups may
    not overlap.
    Electrode charges have a Gaussian charge distribution with reciprocal width
    eta.
    The energy minimization is achieved via matrix inversion :ref:`(Wang)
    <Wang5>`.
    The fix necessitates the use of a long range solver that can provide the 
    matrix of electrode-electrode interactions and a vector of 
    electrode-electrolyte interactions. 
    The Kspace styles *ewald/conp* and *pppm/conp* :ref:`(Ahrens-Iwers) <Ahrens>` are 
    created specifically for this task.

    For systems with non-periodic boundaries in one or two directions dipole
    corrections are available with the :doc:`kspace_modify <kspace_modify>`.
    For ewald/conp a two-dimensional Ewald summation can be used by setting
    "slab ew2d":

.. code-block:: LAMMPS

   kspace_modify slab <slab_factor>
   kspace_modify wire <wire_factor>
   kspace_modify slab ew2d

.. warning::

   Atom positions of electrode particles have to be fixed at all times.
