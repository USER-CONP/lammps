Description
"""""""""""

The fix charge_update implements a constant potential method (CPM)
(:ref:`Siepmann <Siepmann>`, :ref:`Reed <Reed3>`).  Charges of groups specified
as group-ID and with the `couple` keyword are adapted to meet their respective
potential at every time step.  An arbitrary number of electrodes can be set but
the respective groups may not overlap.  Electrode charges have a Gaussian charge
distribution with reciprocal width eta.  The energy minimization is achieved via
matrix inversion :ref:`(Wang) <Wang5>`.

The fix necessitates the use of a long range solver that can provide the matrix
of electrode-electrode interactions and a vector of electrode-electrolyte
interactions.  The Kspace styles *ewald/conp* and *pppm/conp*
:ref:`(Ahrens-Iwers) <Ahrens-Iwers>` are created specifically for this task.

For systems with non-periodic boundaries in one or two directions dipole
corrections are available with the :doc:`kspace_modify <kspace_modify>`.  For
ewald/conp a two-dimensional Ewald summation :ref:`(Hu) <Hu>` can be used by
setting "slab ew2d":

.. code-block:: LAMMPS

   kspace_modify slab <slab_factor>
   kspace_modify wire <wire_factor>
   kspace_modify slab ew2d

.. warning::

   Currently, atom positions of electrode particles have to be fixed at all times.
